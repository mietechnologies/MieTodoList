# MieTodoList

A simple todo list iOS App. Removed the clutter that other apps add without removing the useful functionality. Keeping with a minimalist design to remove busyness from the designs and to make the app easier to navigate and use.

## Description

A simple todo list app all around getting things done. Sometimes you just need a simple list that you can work at, one item at a time. Then tomorrow just carry over what you didn't finish the day before. If an item no longer serves a purpose, delete it from the list entirely. Try to complete a certain percentage of your tasks each day.

## Problem Statement

This iOS App was created out of frustration with the current offerings for Todo List apps and simple list solutions. I like to just create a list of things (sometimes prioritized, sometimes not) that I want to get done in the near future. A simple list containing things that I think of during the day but know I will forget if I don't write it down. Then when I go back to update the list by marking off things I've accomplished, or even add more to the list in subsequent days, only to find out that I've lost the scrap of paper or don't remember which app I last used to store my todo list. So I decided, as a Mobile Software Developer, I can make a better and simpler solution.

## Mission Statement

I believe, as with every App we make here at MieTech LLC., that we can apply our company's core beliefs to the concept of a simple todo list:

- [ ] 1. Make the digital version just as easy to use as the analog.
- [ ] 2. Offer more features/functions to the digital that isn't common with the analog.
- [ ] 3. Add quality of life improvements that make the digital experience more enjoyable than the analog.

To resolve this app's "problems" this app must accomplish the following things:

- [ ] A simple, friendly, and easy-to-use interface
- [ ] Check-in functionality to give the user the option to mark items as "complete" from the past day on first opening the app for the day
- [ ] A reminder, after a certain period of time, to ask if an item is still important and needs to still be on the list (if not, remove it)
- [ ] The ability to prioritize tasks
- [ ] The ability to sort tasks by priority
- [ ] The ability to easily distinguish between different priority tasks
- [ ] The ability to see how I did on completion (%) the day prior
