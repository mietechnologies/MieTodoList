# Changelog
<!-- When a new release is being made, follow the instructions below:
        1. Under the [Unreleased] header, add a new header above the current changes
            following this format: [#.#.#] - YYYY.MM.DD
        2. Copy the log headers under the [Unreleased] header (but above the newly
            created header)
    
    Also, as a note, entries in the this file should follow these standards:
        1. They must start with a bullet point '-', and a description of the change
            that has been implemented (this is not publicly facing, so it may be 
            worded in a way that the team would understand)
        2. Using the link notation, [Link](www.link-site.com), it should link to
            the Asana Task (if there is one). For the link title, use the Asana
            Task title. If the Task in question is a subtask of a larger task,
            use the parent task's title.
 -->
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
